ldms
====

ldms is a simple program to add extra security to prevent cold boot attacks and other attacks which could be performed when an attacker has physical access to the machine.

ldms relies heavily on element of surprise and doesn't give fully protection but improves it. It doesn't protect you from cleanly performed cold boot attack!



TODO
====
* Implement screen detection (unpractical) (canceled)
* Network detection linux kernel socket for events possibly available?
* Sensor based detection? no events busy waiting
